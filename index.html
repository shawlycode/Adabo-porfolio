        <h4>Technical Lead</h4>
        <p>
          A software team works together to ensure the smooth delivery of a
          product. As a tech lead, I balance priorities, communicate clear
          goals, and make apt decisions, all while taking into account my team’s
          capabilities and the product’s deliverables. Since each position on
          the team has some involvement in the technical operation, I make sure
          that each team member has a handle on their portion of the software
          development process to ensure the delivered product meets the client’s
          expectations.
